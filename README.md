# Exploring-67-years-of-LEGO
This is a project on [DataCamp](http://www.datacamp.com/)

The [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) database includes data on every LEGO set that ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, you will get to explore the Rebrickable database. 

Open the **notebook.ipynb** to see details.

To repeat this work on your own computer, please download the cvs files and put them in a folder called **datasets** and put this folder together with **notebook.ipynb** in another folder.
